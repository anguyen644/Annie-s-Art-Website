<!--Terms and Services-->
 <h2 id = "sheet1">
        Terms and Conditions
    </h2>
    <p id = "para1">
        By commissioning me you are agreeing to the following terms. Please read carefully.
    </p>

    <p id = "para">
        Contact
    </p>

    <li ID = "para2">
        I can be contacted through Instagram or Discord (both preferred), as well as email. I respond the fastest on Instagram and Discord, but my email (coginovila@gmail.com) is checked semi-frequently.
    </li>

    <p id = "para">
        Payment
    </p>

    <li ID = "para2">
        Payment must be received by me FULLY upfront before I start on your commission.
    </li>

    <li ID = "para2">
        Commissions must be paid through Cashapp (preferred) or Paypal.
    </li>

    <li ID = "para2">
        I do not do full refunds. A half-refund may be requested after the initial sketch is sent, but after that, no refunds are given out. The exception is if I must cancel your commission, in which a full refund will be sent back.
    </li>

    <p id = "para">
        General Guidelines
    </p>

    <li ID = "para2">
        All commissions should be requested with some form of visual reference for your character. This can be a Toyhouse page or images sent directly to me, etc.

    </li>

    <li ID = "para2">
        I strictly only do human/humanoid commissions. I do not do animal, furry, or mecha commissions. I am also not good at drawing old people or buff people... OTL
    </li>

    <li ID = "para2">
        I can decline or cancel a commission (with a full refund) for any reason.
    </li>

    <p id = "para">
        Process
    </p>

    <li ID = "para2">
        Once payment is received, I will start working and send an initial sketch that you can request revisions on. After, I will update you on the process a few times until completion.

    </li>

    <li ID = "para2">
        Revisions/changes can be requested at any stage, such as color changes and detail revisions. Major changes at later stages of the process (such as changing expression majorly or pose) will be denied, so please request early on in the sketch phase. Revisions requested after the final piece is sent will have a limit of up to two free minor revisions.


    </li>

    <li ID = "para2">
        Speedpaints (using CSP's timelapse tool) can be requested for chibi commissions for free, but otherwise, a speedpaint will cost an additional fee.


    </li>

    <li ID = "para2">
        Depending on the artwork, canvases can range from 1500x1500px to 2500x2500px at 300 DPI. Final pieces will be sent as PNGs unless requested in another format. If you would like a transparent version of the commission or specific canvas size, please let me know.



    <li ID = "para2">
        Chibi and headshot commissions can be expected to be done within a month of starting. Fullbodies, with or without background, may take up to two to three months of starting. You will be notified of any delays.

 <p id = "para">
        Usage
    </p>

    <li ID = "para2">
        If you would like me to not post your commission on social media, please let me know beforehand.
    </li>

    <li ID = "para2">
        You are free to upload and use the commission in any way, so long as credit is given.
