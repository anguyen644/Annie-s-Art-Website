# Annie-s-Art-Website
Hi! I created a website for my little sister that displays some of her art, her commission sheet, an about me, etc. I challenged myself during June to learn HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap5 to create this website. One of the main goals of mine was to create an aesthetically pleasing website that is easy to read and understand. So, I learned how to make wireframes and tested out different designs. This was a really fun project overall and I'm quite happy with what I haave done!

If you would like to check out the website here is the link: https://anniewilump.netlify.app/about.html


FUTURE UPDATES (as of August 2022):
- One of my goals is to take some time to learn Javascript and include an animation to this website.
- Create a proper home page.
- Add more to the gallery!
